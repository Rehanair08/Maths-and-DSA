 ## About the project
  
The automotive industry is rapidly evolving, with autonomous vehicles becoming a reality. However, real-time decision-making for navigation, collision avoidance, and traffic optimization remains a challenge due to the complexity of processing large datasets. This project integrates quantum computing circuits to enhance the efficiency of autonomous vehicle systems.

We will simulate vehicles using CARLA, an open-source autonomous driving simulator, to test performance across various terrains, weather conditions, and traffic scenarios. Quantum computing will be applied to optimize key driving functions, leveraging its parallel processing power to outperform classical computing approaches.
